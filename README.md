# MusicPlayer
## My excuse to learn the Xamarin Framework

### What is this repository?
This is a basic Music Player app that literally does nothing else.
It's just a fun sideproject so that I can learn the basics of Xamarin and developing Cross-Platform Apps in C#!

### Contributing
If you want to add something, just create a fork, add your things and make a pull request.
It's that easy!

Seriously though do whatever you want lmao
